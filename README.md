# Crypto School AI Strategy - Learn to Win

As CTO AI for Crypto Banter, I’m tuning Crypto School for our crew: 60% young hustlers (18-30) chasing crypto cash, 40% solid learners (30-50) building smarts. Teaching’s half the battle—real-world action’s the rest. My AI plan pumps engagement, revenue, and rep, no profit-tracking needed.
